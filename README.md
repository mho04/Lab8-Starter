Although graceful degradation and service workers are vastly different, they both function to serve the user relating to web application usage. Grace degradation allows users to still use the application even if it was accessed through a method the application wasn't built for (such as an older version of a browser). Similarity service workers allow users to still be able to access the application when network connection is slow or offline.
